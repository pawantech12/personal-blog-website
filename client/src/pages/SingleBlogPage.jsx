            Almost instantly the whole truth of the transaction seemed to rush
            upon her mind, and her wrath was inconceivably violent. She asked me
            a thousand questions in a breath; but, fortunately, was too vehement
            to attend to my embarrassment, which must otherwise have betrayed my
            knowledge of the deceit. Revenge was her first wish; and she vowed
            she would go the next morning to Justice Fielding, and inquire what
            punishment she might lawfully inflict upon the Captain for his
            assault.

            I believe we were an hour at Bishopsgate Street before poor Madame
            Duval could allow any thing to be mentioned but her own story; at
            any length, however, Mr. Branghton told her, that M. Du Bois, and
            all his own family, were waiting for her at his house. A
            hackney-coach was then called, and we proceeded to Snow Hill.

            Mr. Branghton's house is small and inconvenient; though his shop,
            which takes in all the ground floor, is large and commodious. I
            believe I told you before, that he is a silver-smith.

              We were conducted up two pairs of stairs: for the dining-room, Mr.
              Branghton told us, was let. His two daughters, their brother, M.
              Du Bois, and a young man, were at tea.

              They had waited some time for Madame Duval, but I found they had
              not any expectation that I should accompany her; and the young
              ladies.

              I believe, were rather more surprised than pleased when I made my
